# 15min_WomensMarch
15 minute explore of the womens march dataset from data.explore

This is my first 15 minute data explore, and 15 minutes flys by very quickly. I was able to gain a bit of an understanding of the dataset, but not able to do much analysis at this point.

There were issues with state column that I could not work out within the 15 minute limit,  I will look for a package that may allow me to do this in the future.  I believe there was one mentioned on talk python to me.
